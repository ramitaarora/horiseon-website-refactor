# Horiseon Website Refactor
UCLA Bootcamp Module 1 Assignment

## Description

This project is a refactor of the Horiseon Website. Refactoring is necessary in meeting accessibility standards for search engine optimization.

This project helped me recognize the importance of using the proper semantic HTML elements in creating a web page. By refactoring the website in this way, it becomes much cleaner to look at and easier to edit.

Changes made include:

1. Using updated, correct semantic HTML elements (such as `<header>` and `<footer>`) to replace non-descriptive `<div>` tags, as well as create the structure of the HTML page

2. Ensuring the elements follow a logical structuring, where the `<header>` is placed before the `<body>` and the `<footer>` is placed at the end.

3. Adding proper alt attributes to the `<img>` elements that describe the image accurately.

4. Ensuring all heading attributes descend in sequential order.

5. Adding a descriptive title, appropriate for the website's needs.
